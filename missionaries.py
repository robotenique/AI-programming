"""
This simple program solves the missionaries and three cannibals problem,
using a Breadth-First-Search algorithm (BFS).


The problem is stated as follows:

"On one bank of a river are three missionaries and three cannibals. 
There is one boat available that can hold up to two people and that
they would like to use to cross the river. If the cannibals ever
outnumber the missionaries on either of the riverâ€™s banks, the 
missionaries will get eaten. 

How can the boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries 
and cannibals across the river?"

       three positions, each representing an information of the state:
